# Off Average Dataset Calculation

An experiment in making the dataset easier to understand.

---

### What Off Average Is

+ Off average is pretty much a calculation that represents players as how far they were from league average for the
  year.
+ For example, If league average PPG is 10, and a player scores 20 for the year, they are a +10 player. Then the next
  year, if the league average is 5, and the player scores 20, they are now a +15 player.
+ This works in the negative direction as well.

### Why This Is Useful

+ What's so special about 32 PPG? or 15 AST? Why are those numbers impressive?
+ The answer is they are only special in comparison to what is normal.
+ In a league only containing John Stockton, Steve Nash, Magic Johnson, and Mark Jackson, 10 isn't so impressive.
+ This shows how far removed the player was from the pack.
+ The thought process is that a good player will shine through with a large differential when compared to the league.

### Some drawbacks

+ While this metric is useful for all the reasons I just mentioned, it is also limited by its assumption.
+ The main assumption is that league average skill level remains constant year over year.
  + Another way of saying this is that if we dump a specific player in any year, their off average stats won't change.
  + An example: Stockton could play today and still average +8 assists (or whatever the actual number is). He would
    adapt to the style of play and still be better than average by the same amount.
+ By only representing players in terms of league average, we assume 1980s players are the same talent level (on
  average) as 2010s.
  + This is an assumption that I don't support. But this is still useful because eras change. This can still measure
    impact.
  + I'm not looking for the best player of all time, I'm looking for the best players in a specific year, so the off
    average is still useful.
