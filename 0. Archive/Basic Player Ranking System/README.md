# Basic Ranking System

This is for ranking NBA legends using basic statistics.

## Some Notes: 

+ Don't take this too seriously. It's obviously not accurate, so don't come at me. It's just some fun.

## The Results:

+ The results can be found in the dedicated files.
+ They also print out in the Jupyter notebook

## Why I Did This:

+ After an argument with my friend Richard and roommate Nick about the GOAT, Nick and I talked through a basic ranking system. A few hours later, this was born.

## What I Learned:

+ Statistically, Russell Westbrook is the GOAT (LOL)
+ Normalizing stats using pace and League statistics is necessary to compare players across eras.
