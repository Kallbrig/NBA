# Clustering Experiment

Uses KNeighborsClassifier to classify players into categories.

## The Results:

+ I did 4 groups. The 4 groups seemed to be Good Players/Good Teams, Good Players/Bad Teams, Bad Players/Good Teams, Bad Players/Bad Teams.
+ I thought it would use PG, SG, SF and F/C, but it classified a lot more onto team stats.

## Why I Did This:

+ It was an interesting project to try to classify players in a new way regardless of position.

## What I Learned:

+ An interesting KNeighborsClassifier Project.
+ I learned that it's not always clear why rows are divided. This took me about half an hour to determine how they were divided.
